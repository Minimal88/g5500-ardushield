# G5500-ardushield
An arduino shield for controlling a Yaesu G5000 rotator.

## Intro
This is a simple Arduino Shield (compatible for any Duemilenove or Uno like boards) for controlling a Yaesu G5500 Antenna rotator.

This shield is designed to be used with K3NG Rotator controller software (flashed on arduino) which you can find [here](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_rotator_controller).

## Instructions

You have a couple of different options for producing this shield:
* Download the release file for off-the-shelf gerber files for local production.
* Or order the board directly from [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/pu8Rst2N)
* Or download the sourcefiles from the repo and adjust them to your needs

Once you have a board ready make sure to flash the board with the K3NG software, properly configured for the pins assigned to each function.
